# Alarm-Clock-Launcher

This hardware project consisted of a fully-functioning alarm clock to which there was attached a "ball-launcher": a pair of motorized rubber wheels and a servo-driven lever that would push a ball into theose wheels to launch it approximately 10 feet away. The only way then to shut off the alarm clock is to retrueve the ball and place it back in its starting slot, at which point a Hall Effect sensor would detect the magnet embedded in the launched ball and cause the alarm to shut off. There is also an option to add your own alarm clock tunes with an SD card, and all components were integrated with the arduino program stored here.

The project was the official entry into the 2019 MakeOHI/O competition for the team known as *Electronic dream with a pinch of Cheeto* (Dennis Sweeney, Kevin Cooper, Mason Cobb, Zach Jackman). The project went on to win "Best Aesthetic" of those project entered in the competition.
